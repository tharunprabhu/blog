While this is a spoiler-free review, I’ll discuss aspects of the plot and characters in this review. So, I recommend that you watch the movie before reading my review. 

## Brilliant on all fronts.

## 5/5

My first viewing of 1917 was in a regular theatre. I saw it again in a LieMAX after a couple of days. And I saw it for the third time at home in 4K. These viewings have given me enough information and time to think about this movie thoroughly and gather my thoughts about it. Which means I won't have to spend much time writing this review. Also, the fact that I saw this thrice probably already gave away the fact that I loved it very much. 

I have to preface this review by saying War is not a film genre that gets my attention usually. The movie was getting a lot of Oscar buzz and that did pique my interest. But what really prompted me to go see it on the big screen was the fact that it was shot by Roger Deakins. I was quite excited for this one because I knew the movie was filmed to look like one long continuous take. This movie delivers on that front and does much more. It becomes immediately clear that this style of filmmaking is not a gimmick. You truly feel like you are right next to these characters in their treacherous journey and the tension never settles because the scene never cuts. The movie shows the characters traveling through a variety of beautiful landscapes and Deakins captures everything with an incredibly high level of finesse. Roger Deakins plays with light in this movie and has once again proven he is one of the greatest cinematographers of all time. Also, it’s worthy of note that the movie felt just as immersive in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio as it was in IMAX. This isn’t a surprise considering Deakins always frames his shots for the cinemascope ratio. 

1917 is more than a one-shot technical achievement, however. Sure, the plot is really simple and doesn’t have layers to it. However, the fact that this movie was inspired by true stories from director Sam Mendes’ grandfather who served in the First World War makes this movie feel personal and enthralling than most movies. Actors George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver terrific performances. Thomas Newman knocked it out of the park with the score for this movie. Engländer, in particular, is a masterpiece. The production design is outstanding and made me appreciate the thought and effort that went into building some of the sets. There are scenes in this movie that are jaw-droppingly intense and give me chills anytime I watch. 1917 sets a new bar in technical craftsmanship and captivating storytelling and is one of the greatest cinematic experiences to grace the big screen.
